                <h3>My Background</h3>
            </header>
            <center><p>For the past 10 years I have worked in the pest control industry. I started as a laborer installing pest tubes and treating for termites in unfinished houses for Home Team Pest Defense. I was laid off due to being the newest employee when the recession hit. I started working in the retail industry as a salesman for Sears and Vans Skateshop. I later picked up work as an overnight stocker for Toys R Us. Later i was rehired by Home Team Pest Defense as a pest control technician. I started making a name for myself in the company by studying to gain more licenses, working hard in the largest route, training new employees and making the best of my time. I am licensed in general pest, termite technician and inspector, weeds and turf and ornimental. Due to my work ethic and constant learning I transferred to a wildlife removal company. I was the only applicant who had no college degree and was accepted over more qualified candidates. I spent 2 weeks in Georgia training for the position. I was asked by the instructor if I would stay in Georgia and they would send someone else back to Arizona in my place. Once I returned home I applied and was granted a wildlife license through AZ Game and Fish. </p></center>

                <h3>Why I Decided to Learn Programming</h3>
            </header>
            <center><p>My father in law. He is the reason I made the decision to get into the programming world. He kept insisting that i try programming but having a past in physcial labor it didn't seem like a good fit. So one day he came over with a flash drive, and the will to show me what programming really was, and changed my mind with the first line of code. Not only was this "hands on" but it was also very fun and creative. So thank you Ken. You have changed my life and the future of my family.</p></center>
